\abstract{The ability to monitor epistemic uncertainty is critical for
self-directed learning. However, we still know little about young
children's ability to detect uncertainty in their knowledge. Here we
asked whether a spontaneous information gathering behavior -- social
referencing -- is related to epistemic uncertainty during early
childhood. Children ages 2-5 completed a word-learning task in which
they were presented with one or two objects, heard a label, and were
asked to put the labeled object in a bucket. Referential ambiguity was
manipulated through the number of objects present and their familiarity.
In Experiment 1, when there were two novel objects and a novel label,
the referent was ambiguous; when there were two familiar objects, or
only one novel or familiar object, the referent was known or could be
inferred. In Experiment 2, there were either two novel objects, two
familiar objects, or one familiar and one novel object; in the latter
case the referent could be inferred by excluding the familiar object. To
further manipulate the availability of referential cues, the
experimenter gazed at either the target or the center of the table while
labeling the object. In both experiments, children looked at the
experimenter more often while making their response when the referent
was ambiguous. In Experiment 2, children also looked at the experimenter
more when there was one familiar and one novel object, but only when the
experimenter's gaze during labeling was uninformative. These results
suggest that children's social referencing is a sensitive index of
graded epistemic uncertainty.}

\maketitle

Preschoolers quickly learn new concepts, rules, and language. They also
actively explore (Schulz \& Bonawitz, 2007) and ask questions
(Chouinard, Harris, \& Maratsos, 2007) in ways that seem targeted to
maximize learning. These behaviors appear to require children to monitor
epistemic states of ignorance and uncertainty, but young children have
generally been credited with limited ability to monitor mental states
(Sodian, Thoermer, Kristen, \& Perst, 2012). To better understand how
young children actively construct meaning from their environment, more
evidence is needed about the relation between epistemic uncertainty and
information seeking in early childhood. Do young children monitor
uncertainty and engage in active learning behaviors based on this
monitoring, or is early learning better characterized as a process of
integrating information that is generated externally, for example, by
social partners who act as teachers (Csibra \& Gergely, 2006)?

Early metacognitive studies suggested that young children had limited
capacities to reflect on their own thoughts or knowledge. For example,
in one study (Markman, 1977), first-graders failed to recognize that
they did not understand the instructions for a task unless they were
prompted to act it out, while older children successfully identified the
gaps in their understanding without prompting. In another study,
5-year-olds were found to have limited awareness of their own ongoing
thoughts (J. H. Flavell, Green, Flavell, Harris, \& Astington, 1995).
However, these and other studies tended to rely on children's explicit
verbal reports about their mental operations, often in a free-response
format, which might underestimate children's ability to track epistemic
states.

Recently, others have investigated children's uncertainty monitoring
using tasks that do not require a verbal response from children. In one
study, 3- to 5-year-olds completed perceptual discrimination and lexical
identification tasks and reported on their certainty in their choices
using a pictorial confidence scale (Lyons \& Ghetti, 2011). Preschoolers
reported being less confident when they responded incorrectly,
suggesting that they were aware of their likelihood of accuracy based on
their epistemic states. In another study, 3.5-year-olds completed a
memory task in which they could opt out of responding to individual
trials (Balcomb \& Gerken, 2008). Children performed worse on trials
they had opted out of when they were forced to answer them later on,
suggesting that children used the opt-out option strategically to avoid
answering when they were uncertain about their responses. On the other
hand, Hembacher and Ghetti (2014) found that 3-year-olds reported being
equally confident for correct and incorrect responses in a memory task
using a pictorial confidence scale, while 4- and 5-year-olds were less
confident when incorrect, suggesting that there are limits to
3-year-olds abilities to monitor uncertainty, and that some cognitive
states may be more easily reflected on by young children than others. In
sum, preschool-aged children demonstrate an emerging awareness of
epistemic uncertainty in laboratory tasks that do not require a verbal
or open-ended response. However, even the competencies reported in these
studies may underestimate children's ability to track epistemic
uncertainty and act on it. The following section outlines an emerging
body of research that suggests that children actively gather data to
support learning from a young age, in a way that reflects sensitivity to
epistemic uncertainty.

\subsection{Active Learning in Early
Childhood}\label{active-learning-in-early-childhood}

First, there are studies that take inspiration from comparative
metacognition research and ask whether children's spontaneous
information-seeking behaviors track uncertainty. For example, Call and
Carpenter (2001) had 2-year-olds choose between several tubes to find a
hidden sticker. They found that the toddlers were more likely to peek
inside a tube before choosing when they had not seen the baiting of the
tubes compared to when they had, suggesting they were aware of their
knowledge or ignorance and selectively sought confirmatory evidence
before committing to a response when they did not know a sticker's
location. In another study, Goupil, Romand-Monnier, and Kouider (2016)
trained 20-month-olds to look at their parents if they needed help with
a memory task in which they had to locate a hidden toy. Toddlers were
more likely to seek help when they were completely ignorant of the toy's
location, and when the task was more difficult because the delay between
hiding and test was longer.

Others have focused on children's spontaneous exploration of objects
under different epistemic conditions. Stahl \& Feigenson (2015) found
that 11-month-old infants were more likely to explore objects that had
violated physical expectations (e.g., a toy car that appeared to hover
in midair) than those that had made similar trajectories without
appearing to violate physics (e.g., a toy that moved along a platform).
Intriguingly, infants were more likely to explore the objects in ways
that were suited to testing the physical property they had seen violated
(e.g., picking up and dropping the car that had hovered in midair;
banging a toy that had appeared to move through a solid wall). These
results suggest that infants selectively explore objects to disambiguate
causal properties that have been rendered uncertain by a surprising
event.

There is also evidence that young children selectively explore when
evidence is confounded (i.e., when existing evidence supports multiple
causal hypotheses). For example, Schulz \& Bonawitz (2007) found that
preschoolers spent more time playing with a toy when they witnessed
confounded evidence about its causal structure. Children who experienced
a demonstration of a toy in which two levers were simultaneously
depressed and caused two simultaneous events (a toy duck and puppet
popping up) spent more time playing with that toy compared to children
who saw a demonstration in which one lever was depressed at a time,
revealing the unique function of each lever. This finding is consistent
with the prediction that preschool-aged children track causal ambiguity
and spontaneously explore more when they do not have sufficient evidence
to isolate a cause for an effect.

Young children are also capable of independently generating the evidence
they need to distinguish between causal hypotheses. Sim and Xu (2017)
found that 2- and 3-year-olds were able to spontaneously discover first-
and second-order rules to activate a toy (e.g., the triangle block makes
the triangle toy work and toys are activated by shape-matched blocks)
during free-play. Preschoolers also identify the most informative
questions to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses (Ruggeri, Sim, \& Xu,
2017). These behaviors would be unlikely to occur if children did not
have some sensitivity to their epistemic states; they must track
uncertainty in order to intervene effectively and gather disambiguating
data.

These studies highlight that even young children are active learners who
explore based on their epistemic states. They also suggest that
spontaneous information-seeking behaviors may be a fruitful behavioral
index of children's sensitivity to uncertainty. However, much of this
research is confined to situations in which children must discover the
causal properties of interesting objects. Does epistemic uncertainty
drive other types of information seeking across learning domains? A
great deal of early learning involves social partners; what is the role
of uncertainty monitoring in children's social learning? In the next
section we outline previous research on the selectivity of early social
learning.

\subsection{Selective social learning}\label{selective-social-learning}

Many current theories of early learning emphasize the role of social
partners. Starting at birth, infants are particularly attuned to social
information, preferring face-like stimuli over other configurations (M.
C. Frank, Amso, \& Johnson, 2014). Paying special attention to social
partners allows infants and children to learn efficiently by witnessing
others' behaviors and bypassing direct exploration or experience (Csibra
\& Gergely, 2006). Orienting towards social partners also allows infants
and children to take advantage of direct pedagogy. Some have argued that
early mindreading abilities afford infants and children the ability to
interpret pedagogical information as such, allowing for stronger
inferences from pedagogical compared to non-pedagogical information
(Shafto, Goodman, \& Frank, 2012).

Importantly, children are selective in their social learning. Children
track the quality of informants' testimony, and prefer to learn from
people who have a history of accurate testimony (Corriveau \& Harris,
2009; Sobel \& Kushnir, 2013). For example, older preschoolers choose to
learn the words for novel objects from someone who has previously
labeled objects correctly compared to incorrectly (Koenig, Clement, \&
Harris, 2009), and from people who appear confident rather than
uncertain (Sabbagh \& Baldwin, 2001). They also prefer to learn from
people who have proven to be honest rather than dishonest in the past
(Li, Heyman, Xu, \& Lee, 2014). In general, young children appear to be
selective learners with regard to the sources of social information they
seek.

Are children also selective about \emph{when} they seek social
information? That is, do they seek social information only when their
uncertainty about their own mental representations is high? There is
some evidence to suggest that they do, at least in the context of
solving problems of varying difficulty. For example, Vredenburgh \&
Kushnir (2015) found that preschool-aged children selectively sought
help with a task when they were either less competent at the task or
when they reached a difficult step. Coughlin, Hembacher, Lyons and
Ghetti (2014) found that preschoolers were more likely to seek help on
trials of a perceptual discrimination task for which they reported lower
confidence in a separate session in which help was not available.
Additionally, analysis of a corpus of parent-child conversations showed
that preschoolers tend to ask questions that are directed to resolve
gaps in knowledge, and they ask follow-up questions if they receive
uninformative responses (Chouinard et al., 2007).

Help-seeking is only one form of social information-gathering. Infants
and children also engage in social referencing, or checking a social
partner's face for gaze direction and/or reactions to stimuli or events
(Walden \& Ogan, 1988). Young infants have been found to reference
social partners to determine the safety of objects or actions; for
example, infants reference their parents' faces before crossing a visual
cliff of uncertain depth (Sorce, Emde, Campos, \& Klinnert, 1985).
Infants also check adults' faces when they are exposed to potentially
dangerous stimuli or sounds, such as the sound of dogs barking or
spiders (Striano \& Rochat, 2000; Zarbatany \& Lamb, 1985). Thus,
infants and young children are prompted to reference social information
by uncertainty about the safety of a situation.

Social referencing also plays a particularly important role in language
acquisition. Referencing a social partner can provide several types of
disambiguating information during word learning. For example, infants
and children can follow a speaker's gaze direction to infer the referent
of a new word, as people tend to look at the objects they refer to. By
the second year of life infants follow a speaker's gaze and map labels
to objects on the basis of gaze direction (Baldwin, 1991). There is also
evidence that infants' propensity for gaze-following predicts later
language development, highlighting the importance of this behavior for
learning. In addition to monitoring gaze direction, children may
reference a social partner's emotional reaction to a stimulus or event,
which can help disambiguate the appropriateness of a response (Walden \&
Ogan, 1988). Finally, looking at a social partner can be taken as a bid
for help (Vredenburgh \& Kushnir, 2015), and may result in explicit
instruction.

Social referencing can be an efficient source of disambiguating
information, but is it driven by epistemic uncertainty during early
childhood? It could be that social referencing is typically not costly
enough to require selectivity, or that uncertainty signals related to
knowledge representations are too weak to drive information-seeking
behaviors in young children. Similarly, other learning mechanisms such
as the privileging of social information (Ho, MacGlashan, Littman, \&
Cushman, 2017) or tracking of regularities in the environment (Yurovsky
\& Frank, 2015) may be sufficiently powerful to obviate the need for
uncertainty-dependent social referencing in preschool-aged children.

\subsection{Current study}\label{current-study}

The present work asks whether preschoolers reference a speaker more
frequently when the referent of the speech is ambiguous. This work
adapts a paradigm used by Vaish, Demir and Baldwin (2011) in which 13-
to 18-month-olds sat across from an experimenter who produced a label
(e.g., ``a modi!'') in the presence of one or two novel objects. Infants
looked towards the experimenter more often when there were two objects
present, suggesting that infants' social referencing is driven by
referential ambiguity. Here we adapt this procedure for use with
preschoolers, who have a richer behavioral repertoire compared to
infants, and may not reference social information based on uncertainty
for the reasons discussed previously.

We ask whether preschoolers look more at a social partner when they are
uncertain about the identity of a referent (Experiment 1) and whether
they are sensitive to graded uncertainty based on the amount of
disambiguating evidence available (Experiment 2). Furthermore, we
examine social referencing across the time course of an event that
includes a speaker labeling an object and requesting that the child put
the object in a bucket. Thus, we can determine whether children
differentially reference a speaker depending on the social information
available at different moments. For example, children might reference a
speaker during labeling to discover the gaze direction of the speaker,
and during their choice about which object to pick to determine the
speaker's evaluation of their choice.

\end{CodeChunk}

\section{Experiment 1}\label{experiment-1}

In Experiment 1, we examined whether children would visually reference a
speaker more often when the speaker produced a referentially ambiguous
label compared to an unambiguous label. Children sat across from an
experimenter who labeled an object on the table between them (Figure
\ref{fig:design}). The experimenter then asked the child to place the
named object in a bucket. Across trials, there were either one or two
objects on the table, which were either familiar or novel to the child.
This design allowed us to test whether merely having more than one
object present is sufficient to increase social referencing (which could
not be ruled out by Vaish et al.), or if referential ambiguity (and thus
epistemic uncertainty) is the underlying factor. If the latter is true,
we expected children to increase their looking to the experimenter only
on trials with two unfamiliar objects, when the object-label mapping was
not known and could not be inferred.

We were interested in the amount of social referencing children
exhibited across the trial. We considered four different phases of each
trial based on the notion that children might expect different social
information at different stages of the task. Specifically, we predicted
that children might expect the speaker's gaze direction to be
informative during the labeling itself, as speakers tend to look at
objects they refer to. We predicted that later in the trial, as children
reached for an object and placed it in the bucket, they might expect
evaluative feedback about their choice (e.g., facial expressions of
encouragement or discouragement).

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited a planned sample of 80 children ages 2-5 years from the
Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, California.\footnote{Planned
  sample size, exclusion criteria, and analysis plan preregistered at
  \url{https://osf.io/y7mvt}.} The sample included 20 2-year-olds (mean
age 32.0 months), 20 3-year-olds (mean age 42.7 months), 20 4-year-olds
(mean age 55.8 months), and 20 5-year-olds (mean age 65.2 months). An
additional 20 children participated but were removed from analyses
because they heard English less than 75\% of the time at home (\emph{n}
= 10), because they were unable to complete at least half of the trials
in the task (\emph{n} = 4), because of parental interference (\emph{n} =
1), or due to experimenter or technical errors (\emph{n} = 5).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design}

Children were presented with one or two objects, heard a label, and were
asked to put the labeled object in a bucket. Half of the objects were
selected to be familiar to children (e.g., a cow) and half were selected
to be novel (e.g., a nozzle). There were four trial types: one-familiar,
one-novel, two-familiar, and two-novel. There were three trials of each
type, for a total of twelve trials. Trial types were presented
sequentially in an order that was counterbalanced across participants.
The assignment of individual objects to trial types was counterbalanced.
On familiar trials, the familiar label for the target object was used
(e.g., ``cow''). On novel trials, a novel label was used (e.g.,
``dawnoo'').

The critical manipulation was of referential ambiguity; one-familiar and
two-familiar trials were referentially unambiguous, as children were
expected to be certain about the objects and their labels. Similarly, on
one-novel trials, children were expected to be certain about the label
referent as there was only one option. However, two-novel trials were
referentially ambiguous, as the novel label could apply to either novel
object.

Throughout the task, the experimenter never gazed at the object they
were labeling, or responded to children's verbal or non-verbal bids for
help by indicating the correct object. Thus, children were expected to
remain uncertain about the referent throughout the trial when two novel
objects were present.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Throughout the study, the child sat at one end of a large circular
table, and the experimenter stood at the opposite end. Each trial of the
task proceeded as follows: the experimenter placed one or two objects on
the left and/or right sides of the table, out of reach of the child so
that the child could not interact with the toys during the labeling
event. For one-object trials, the location of the object (left or right)
alternated between trials.

After placing the objects, the experimenter said ``Hey look, there's a
(target) here.'' The experimenter gazed at the center of the table
rather than the object they labeled. The experimenter waited
approximately two seconds based on a visual metronome placed within view
before saying, ``Can you put the (target) in the bucket?'' They then
pushed the object(s) forward within reach of the child, and placed a
plastic bucket in the center of the table, also within reach of the
child. Prior to the twelve experimental trials, there were two training
trials: a one-familiar trial and a two-familiar trial, to acquaint the
child with the procedure. A camera placed to the side of the
experimenter captured the participant's face, so that looking behavior
could be coded from video.

\subsubsection{Coding procedure}\label{coding-procedure}

Videos were coded using DataVyu software (\url{http://datavyu.org}). For
each participant, we coded the number of times they referenced the
experimenter across the trial. Because we were interested in the precise
circumstances in which children feel uncertain enough to reference a
speaker, we coded the number of looks that occurred during four phases
of the trial: a \emph{label} phase, which began at the utterance of the
label and ended when the experimenter began to slide the objects, a
\emph{slide} phase, in which the experimenter slid the object(s) into
the child's reach, a \emph{planning} phase, which began at the end of
the slide and ended when the child touched an object, and a
\emph{response} phase, which began when the child touched an object and
ended when the child released the object into the bucket. A second coder
independently scored the number of looks for one third of the trials for
each participant to establish reliability.

Table \ref{tab:phases} displays the average durations of each of the
four phases. The \emph{label} and \emph{response} phases are longer on
average than the \emph{planning} and \emph{slide} phases. However, note
that we are interested in comparing the amount of social referencing
across ambiguity conditions and not across phases directly.

We next examined children's accuracy (i.e., their rates of putting the
correct item in the bucket for two-familiar trials, in which there was a
correct response). Children sometimes put two items in the bucket
(20.00\% of trials), despite instructions to choose only one. If they
put the correct item in the bucket first followed by the incorrect
object, we counted their response as correct. If they put the incorrect
object in first, we counted their response as incorrect. Children also
occasionally declined to choose an item (0.83\% of trials); these trials
are excluded from accuracy analyses. Children's accuracy is displayed in
Table \ref{tab:acc_table}. Overall children generally chose the correct
item for 2-familiar trials, indicating that they understood the task and
were motivated to answer correctly. While 3- to 5-year-olds performed
close to ceiling (92\% - 99\%), 2-year-olds were less accurate (76\%),
but still performed significantly above chance (\emph{t} = 43.20 ,
\emph{p} \textless{}.001).

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsubsection{Social referencing}\label{social-referencing}

Results of Experiment 1 are presented in Figure \ref{fig:results_e1}.
Inter-rater reliability for the number of looks in each phase was high,
intraclass correlation \emph{r} = .97, \emph{p}\textless{}.001. To test
our prediction that referential ambiguity (i.e., having two novel
objects) would produce more social referencing, we fit mixed-effects
linear regression models separately for each phase with the following
structure:
\texttt{number\ of\ looks\ \textasciitilde{}\ number\ of\ objects\ *\ familiarity\ *\ age\ in\ months\ +\ (number\ of\ objects\ +\ familiarity\ \textbar{}\ subject)}.
A single model with phase as a factor did not converge.

We did not find any main or interaction effects of number of objects,
familiarity, or age on number of looks during the \emph{label} or
\emph{slide} phases. Thus, mere novelty or the presence of multiple
objects was not enough to increase social referencing. However, we found
an interaction effect of number of objects and familiarity during the
\emph{planning} (\(\beta\) = 0.21, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and
\emph{response} phases (\(\beta\) = 0.60, \emph{p} \textless{} .001),
such that 2-novel trials were associated with more looking. There was no
interaction with age in either phase.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/emilyfae/socref_uncert}}
In summary, children looked to the experimenter more often when planning
and executing a response under uncertainty. These results suggest that
children were aware that they did not have sufficient knowledge to
answer independently, and referenced the speaker to resolve this
uncertainty.

We did not find the expected effect of referential ambiguity in the
\emph{label} phase. It is possible that children failed to predict that
they would need more information until later in the trial, when they
were actually faced with making a decision. Another possibility is that
children's looking was at ceiling during the labeling phase, perhaps
because children tend to look at someone who is speaking regardless of
the need for referential disambiguation. A third possibility is that
this finding is an artifact of our design, in which the experimenter
gazed at the center of the table rather than the referent of the label.
Children may have realized that the experimenter's gaze direction during
labeling was not informative. Alternatively, children may have found it
strange to interact with an experimenter who did not gaze at the object
they were labeling, which may have produced unnatural patterns of social
referencing. Experiment 2 tests these possibilities and examines whether
children's social referencing is sensitive to graded uncertainty.

\section{Experiment 2}\label{experiment-2}

Experiment 2 was designed to replicate Experiment 1 and investigate
whether children's social referencing is sensitive to uncertainty based
on graded evidence about a label's referent. A hallmark of successful
uncertainty monitoring is being less confident when the probability of
accuracy is lower (Kiani \& Shadlen, 2009). This ability includes
awareness of complete ignorance, but also of graded evidence in mental
representations (Fleming, Dolan, \& Frith, 2012; Ghetti, Lyons,
Lazzarin, \& Cornoldi, 2008), which may be important for predicting
outcomes and guiding behavior.

To examine children's social referencing on the basis of graded
referential evidence, we added 1-novel-1-familiar trials. For these
trials, we expected that children would be able to infer the referent by
excluding the familiar object as a possibility. For example, when a toy
lion and a novel item were present, they could exclude that the speaker
was referring to the lion as a ``blicket'' (Markman \& Wachtel, 1988).
Since we did not observe any difference between one-familiar and
one-novel trials, we eliminated single-object trials, leaving the
2-familiar and 2-novel trials. We predicted that children might be less
certain about their choice on these trials compared to when the label
and referent were familiar to them (2-familiar trials), but more
confident than when there are no cues to reference (2-novel trials).

To further manipulate the availability of referential evidence, we
varied between participants whether or not the experimenter's gaze
during labeling was informative (they gazed at either the referent of
their label or the center of the table). This manipulation also allowed
us to determine whether children selectively reference gaze during
labeling when gaze is informative. In Experiment 1, we did not observe
an effect of age, so we restricted the current sample to 3- and
4-year-olds.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited a planned sample of 80 children ages 3-4 years from the
Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, California.\footnote{Planned
  sample size, exclusion criteria, and analysis plan preregistered at
  \url{https://osf.io/y7mvt/}.} The sample included 40 3-year-olds (mean
age 42.9 months) and 40 4-year-olds (mean age 53.5 months). An
additional 20 children participated but were removed from analyses
because they heard English less than 75\% of the time at home (\emph{n}
= 9), because they were unable to complete at least half of the trials
in the task (\emph{n} = 7), or due to experimenter or technical errors
(\emph{n} = 4).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design-1}

The stimuli and design were similar to Experiment 1 but included three
trial types: 2-familiar, 2-novel, and 1-novel-1-familiar. There were
four of each trial type, totaling twelve trials. In addition, we
manipulated the experimenter's gaze behavior between participants. For
half of the participants, the experimenter looked at the center of the
table while labeling objects; for the remaining half, they looked
directly at the objects they labeled.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1, except that there were
three practice trials (two familiar trials and one novel trial). We
included two familiar trials during the practice so that children would
remain motivated to complete the task.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion-1}

\subsubsection{Phase durations and
accuracy}\label{phase-durations-and-accuracy-1}

The mean durations of the phases for Experiment 2 are presented in Table
\ref{tab:phases}. They varied in length similar to Experiment 1. We
additionally examined children's accuracy for familiar and mutual
exclusivity trials, as well as novel trials in the Gaze condition, as
all of these had a ``correct'' answer. Children's accuracy was
calculated using the same criteria as in Experiment 1 (Table
\ref {tab:acc_table}).

To quantify the effects of trial type, gaze condition, and age in months
on the probability of accuracy, we fit the following mixed-effects
logistic regression model:
\texttt{correct\ \textasciitilde{}\ trial\ type\ *\ gaze\ +\ age\ +\ (1\textbar{}\ subject)}.
Accuracy was significantly lower for novel (\(\beta\) = -2.27, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) and mutual trials (\(\beta\) = -2.23, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) compared to familiar trials, and trial type interacted
with gaze condition such that accuracy was significantly higher in the
gaze condition for novel (\(\beta\) = 3.41, \emph{p} \textless{} .001)
and mutual trials (\(\beta\) = 1.12, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). Age did
not significantly predict accuracy (\(\beta\) = 0.18, \emph{p} = .12).

\subsubsection{Social referencing and referential
ambiguity}\label{social-referencing-and-referential-ambiguity}

Children's social referencing based on trial type and gaze condition are
presented in Figure \ref{fig:results_e2}. Inter-rater reliability for
the number of looks in each phase was again high, intraclass correlation
\emph{r} = .97, \emph{p}\textless{}.001. To quantify the main and
interactive effects of familiarity, gaze informativity, phase, and age
on social referencing, we fit a mixed-effects linear regression model
with the following structure:
\texttt{number\ of\ looks\ \textasciitilde{}\ familiarity\ *\ age\ in\ months\ *\ gaze\ *\ phase\ +\ (familiarity\ \textbar{}\ subject)}.
In contrast to Experiment 1, a model with phase as a predictor
converged.

First, do children reference a speaker more often when the objects and
label are novel? Phase interacted with familiarity such that the
\emph{response} phase of novel trials was associated with significantly
more looks (\(\beta\) = 0.28, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). This result is
consistent with results from Experiment 1. However, in contrast to
Experiment 1, the number of looks was not significantly greater for
novel trials in the \emph{planning} phase.

We were also interested in whether mutual exclusivity trials would
elicit an intermediate amount of uncertainty. We observed a three-way
interaction of familiarity, gaze, and phase, such that the response
phase of mutual exclusivity trials in the no-referential-gaze condition
was associated with significantly more looks (\(\beta\) = -0.20,
\emph{p} \textless{} .01). Thus, mutual exclusivity trials were
associated with greater looking only when the experimenter did not
provide informative gaze. This finding is intriguing given that children
should be able to solve mutual exclusivity trials without gaze
information. Instead, these results suggest that children relatively
uncertain while making a decision if excluding the familiar object is
their only cue to reference, but this uncertainty is resolved if the
speaker's gaze is informative. On the other hand, informative gaze
during labeling did not lessen social referencing for novel trials,
suggesting that gaze information alone was not sufficient to reduce
uncertainty. Instead, both gaze information and mutual exclusivity
provided evidence about a label-object pairing, and children required
both types of evidence to feel certain about their response.

Finally, we observed a four-way interaction such that the
\emph{response} phase of novel trials in the gaze condition was
associated with more looking with increasing age (\(\beta\) = -0.02,
\emph{p} \textless{} .01), suggesting that children may become more
selective in their social referencing as they get older. It may be that
children improve in their ability to monitor the need for disambiguating
information, or they may become more likely to recognize that social
information can be a source of disambiguation.

We did not observe selective social referencing during the \emph{label}
phase, even when referential gaze was available. This result rules out
the possibility that children are less selective during labeling because
they learned that gaze direction was not informative.

\end{CodeChunk}

\subsubsection{Social referencing and
accuracy}\label{social-referencing-and-accuracy}

Another window into the relation between epistemic uncertainty and
social referencing is to examine the amount of social referencing
associated with accurate and inaccurate responses from children. Since
incorrect responses are more likely to be associated with decision
uncertainty (Kiani \& Shadlen, 2009), more looks to the experimenter on
incorrect trials would suggest that children reference social
information when they are uncertain.

To quantify the relation between accuracy and social referencing across
phases, we fit a mixed-effects linear regression model with the
following structure:
\texttt{number\ of\ looks\ \textasciitilde{}\ accuracy\ *\ age\ in\ months\ *\ phase\ +\ (1\ \textbar{}\ subject)}.
Results showed that accuracy and phase interacted such that children
looked at the experimenter significantly more during the labeling phase
of accurate trials (\(\beta\) = 0.41, \emph{p} \textless{} .001), and
significantly less in the \emph{response} phase of accurate trials
(\(\beta\) = -0.99, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

In summary, children were more likely to look at the experimenter as
they executed their response when they answered incorrectly, suggesting
that social referencing is associated with epistemic uncertainty. This
pattern increased with age. Additionally, children were more likely to
answer correctly if they referenced the speaker during the labeling
phase. This pattern could be due to children obtaining referential
information based on the experimenter's gaze in the gaze condition, or
it could represent trials in which children were more engaged in the
task.

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

During the preschool years, children are increasingly able to actively
gather information through help-seeking and exploration (Chouinard et
al., 2007; Schulz \& Bonawitz, 2007). Do children monitor their own
uncertainty to guide these behaviors, or are they indiscriminate with
regard to underlying knowledge states? Here, we examined whether young
children's social referencing during a word-learning task was driven by
uncertainty about a label's referent.

We found that referential ambiguity strongly predicted children's social
referencing. Specifically, we observed this selectivity when children
were forced to decide which object the speaker was referring to. We
speculate that children referenced the speaker during the decision
process because they expected evaluative feedback about their choice,
either implicitly through the adult's facial expressions, or through an
explicit response. This idea is consistent with other recent research
that has found that preschoolers and toddlers seek help selectively when
a problem is difficult or they are less skilled (Goupil et al., 2016;
Vredenburgh \& Kushnir, 2015).

Most intriguingly, we found that children's looking was driven by graded
referential evidence. In the case of mutual exclusivity trials, children
could solve the problem of reference by excluding the familiar item
(Markman \& Wachtel, 1988). Thus, unlike novel trials, they likely had
some signal about the correct object-label mapping. If children simply
monitored the presence or absence of such signals, they would have
consistently treated mutual exclusivity trials as familiar trials.
Instead, their social referencing depended on a combination of cues from
mutual exclusivity and gaze informativity, suggesting that they are
sensitive to graded evidence and seek disambiguating information only
when uncertainty is relatively high. Children's greater social
referencing on trials with only one cue to reference (i.e., mutual
exclusivity trials with no referential gaze and novel trials with
referential gaze) additionally suggests that children may remain
uncertain about a new label-object mapping if they have not received
confirmation of its accuracy, for example, through explicit feedback or
gaze direction.

On the other hand, we found no evidence for selective social referencing
as the object was being labeled. One possibility is that young children
do not recognize the need for disambiguating information until they need
to make a decision. Another possibility is that preschool-aged children
spontaneously look at a speaker regardless of ambiguity, and additional
looking was not needed or possible. Notably, Vaish et al. observed
selective referencing during labeling among infants. Since infants in
that study were holding one of the objects during labeling, referencing
the speaker would have required them to disengage from that object, and
may therefore have been more costly, promoting selectivity. Future
research with preschoolers that includes a greater trade-off between
attentional options would help to distinguish among these possibilities.
Overall, these results provide evidence that preschool-aged children
monitor graded uncertainty in their mental representations and act on
that uncertainty through spontaneous information-seeking.
