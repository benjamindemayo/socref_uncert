\begin{abstract}
The ability to monitor epistemic uncertainty is critical for
self-directed learning. However, we still know little about young
children's ability to detect uncertainty in their mental
representations. Here we asked whether a spontaneous information
gathering behavior -- social referencing -- is driven by uncertainty
during early childhood. Children ages 2-5 completed a word-learning task
in which they were presented with one or two objects, heard a label, and
were asked to put the labeled object in a bucket. Referential ambiguity
was manipulated through the number of objects present and their
familiarity. In Experiment 1, when there were two novel objects and a
novel label, the referent was ambiguous; when there were two familiar
objects, or only one novel or familiar object, the referent was known or
could be inferred. In Experiment 2, there were either two novel objects,
two familiar objects, or one familiar and one novel object; in the
latter case the referent could be inferred by excluding the familiar
object. To further manipulate the availability of referential cues, the
experimenter gazed at either the target or the center of the table while
labeling the object. In both experiments, children looked at the
experimenter more often while making their response when the referent
was ambiguous. In Experiment 2, children also looked at the experimenter
more when there was one familiar and one novel object, but only when the
experimenter's gaze during labeling was uninformative. These results
suggest that children's social referencing is a sensitive index of
graded epistemic uncertainty.

Preschoolers quickly learn new concepts, rules, and language. They also
actively explore and ask questions in ways that seem targeted to
maximize learning (Chouinard, Harris, \& Maratsos, 2007; Schulz \&
Bonawitz, 2007). However, we still have an incomplete understanding of
young children's ability to monitor their own mental states, in
particular, their epistemic uncertainty (Sodian, Thoermer, Kristen, \&
Perst, 2012). Do preschool-aged children monitor uncertainty and
actively guide their learning behaviors on the basis of this monitoring,
or is early learning better characterized as a process of integrating
information that is largely generated externally, for example, by social
partners who act as teachers (Csibra \& Gergely, 2006)?

A hallmark of successful uncertainty monitoring is being less confident
when the probability of accuracy is lower (Robinson, Johnson, \&
Herndon, 1997). This ability includes awareness of complete ignorance,
but also of graded evidence in mental representations, which is
considered important for predicting outcomes and regulating behavior
(Lyons \& Zelazo, 2011). During adulthood, accurately representing one's
own learning progress allows for efficient self-directed study and
predicts learning outcomes (Dunlosky \& Rawson, 2012). There is mixed
evidence about whether young children can accomplish this type of
self-monitoring. For example, 3-year-olds report being equally confident
about correct and incorrect responses in memory tasks (Hembacher \&
Ghetti, 2014). Preschoolers report being less confident when they are
wrong in other tasks, but they are typically overconfident overall
(Coughlin, Hembacher, Lyons, \& Ghetti, 2015; Lipowski, Merriman, \&
Dunlosky, 2013). However, these studies may underestimate young
children's uncertainty monitoring, as they typically rely on explicit
metacognitive reports. Children may learn to respond appropriately to
uncertainty in everyday learning situations before they can bring it
fully into consciousness and report on it.

Several studies have provided evidence that children's spontaneous
information-seeking behaviors might track uncertainty. Call and
Carpenter (2001) had 2-year-olds choose between several tubes to find a
hidden sticker. They found that the toddlers were more likely to peek
inside a tube before choosing when they had not seen the baiting of the
tubes compared to when they had, suggesting they were aware of their
ignorance and managed to delay their response until they were
sufficiently confident. In another study, Goupil, Romand-Monnier, \&
Kouider (2016) found that 20-month-olds were more likely to seek help by
looking at their parents when they were unable to respond accurately in
a memory task. These spontaneous information-gathering behaviors may
provide a window into early uncertainty monitoring, and allow us to ask
questions about its development.

Here, we focus on the role of uncertainty in guiding social referencing
-- one form of information gathering -- during word learning.
Referencing a social partner can provide several forms of disambiguating
information. First, children can follow a speaker's gaze direction to
infer the referent of a new word, as people tend to look at objects they
are referring to. By the second year of life infants follow a speaker's
gaze and map labels to objects on the basis of gaze direction (Baldwin,
1991). There is also evidence that infants' propensity for
gaze-following predicts later language development (Carpenter, Nagel,
Tomasello, Butterworth, \& Moore, 1998), highlighting the importance of
this behavior for learning. In addition to monitoring gaze direction,
children can reference a social partner's emotional reaction to a
stimulus or event, which can help disambiguate the appropriateness of a
response (Walden \& Ogan, 1988). Finally, looking at a social partner
can be taken as a bid for help (Vredenburgh \& Kushnir, 2015), and may
result in explicit instruction.

Social referencing can be an efficient source of disambiguating
information, but is it driven by uncertainty during early childhood? It
could be that social referencing is not costly enough to require
selectivity. Similarly, children may simply respond to external events,
for example, by fixating towards someone who is speaking, without
monitoring their knowledge states. Vaish, Demir and Baldwin (2011)
addressed this question with infants. Thirteen to 18-month-olds sat
across from an experimenter who produced a label (e.g., ``a modi!) in
the presence of one or two novel objects. Infants looked up to the
experimenter more often when there were two objects present, and the
referent was thus ambiguous. This finding provides initial evidence that
infants selectively reference a speaker's gaze direction when they are
uncertain about the referent of a label, rather than indiscriminately
looking at someone who is speaking. However, one possibility is that
infants responded to visual complexity (i.e., the number of objects
present) rather than a representation of their own knowledge. The
present work adapts this framework to ask whether preschoolers' social
referencing tracks uncertainty when the number of objects present is
held constant and when there is graded evidence about the referent of a
label.

\section{Experiment 1}\label{experiment-1}

We first asked whether preschool-aged children's social referencing
reflects sensitivity to uncertainty based on referential ambiguity. In
Experiment 1, we examined whether children would reference a speaker
more often when she produced a referentially ambiguous label compared to
an unambiguous label. Children sat across from an experimenter who
labeled an object on the table between them (Figure \ref{fig:design}).
After labeling an object, the experimenter asked the child to place the
named object in a bucket. Across trials, there were either one or two
objects on the table, which were either familiar or unfamiliar to the
child. This design allowed us to test whether merely having more than
one object present is sufficient to increase social referencing (which
could not be ruled out by Vaish et al.), or if referential ambiguity
(and thus epistemic uncertainty) is the underlying factor. If the latter
is true, we expected children to increase their looking to the
experimenter only on trials with two unfamiliar objects, when the
object-label mapping was not known and could not be inferred.

We were interested in the amount of social referencing children
exhibited across the trial. We considered four different phases of each
trial based on the notion that children might expect different social
information at different stages of the task. Specifically, we predicted
that children might expect the speaker's gaze direction to be
informative during the labeling itself, as speakers tend to look at
objects they refer to. We predicted that later in the trial, as children
reached for an object and placed it in the bucket, children might expect
confirmation of the accuracy of their choice. We were interested in
whether children would reference the speaker to a greater degree across
these phases when referential ambiguity was high, which would indicate
sensitivity to epistemic uncertainty. On the other hand, if children's
looking is driven by external stimuli and not epistemic uncertainty, we
might find that they reference the speaker more when there are two
objects present, regardless of familiarity, or when novel objects are
present, regardless of the number of objects.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited a planned sample of 80 children ages 2-5 years from the
Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, California.\footnote{Planned
  sample size, exclusion criteria, and analysis plan preregistered at
  \url{https://osf.io/y7mvt}} The sample included 20 2-year-olds (mean
age 31.71 months), 20 3-year-olds (mean age 42.65 months), 20
4-year-olds (mean age 55.85 months), and 20 5-year-olds (mean age 65.11
months). An additional 20 children participated but were removed from
analyses because they heard English less than 75\% of the time at home
(\emph{n} = 10), because they were unable to complete at least half of
the trials in the task (\emph{n} = 4), because of parental interference
(\emph{n} = 1), or due to experimenter or technical errors (\emph{n} =
5).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design}

Children were presented with one or two objects, heard a label, and were
asked to put the labeled object in a bucket. Half of the objects were
selected to be familiar to children (e.g., a cow) and half were selected
to be novel (e.g., a nozzle). There were four trial types: one-familiar,
one-novel, two-familiar, and two-novel. There were three trials of each
type, for a total of twelve trials. Trial types were presented
sequentially in an order that was counterbalanced across participants.
The assignment of individual objects to trial types was counterbalanced.
On familiar trials, the familiar label for the target object was used
(e.g., ``cow''). On novel trials, a novel label was used (e.g.,
``dawnoo'').

The critical manipulation was of referential ambiguity; on one-familiar
and two-familiar trials, there was no referential ambiguity, as children
were expected to be certain about the objects and their labels.
Similarly, on one-novel trials, children were expected to be certain
about the label referent as there was only one option. However, on
two-novel trials, the referent was ambiguous, as the novel label could
apply to either novel object.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Throughout the study, the child sat at one end of a large circular
table, and the experimenter stood at the opposite end. Each trial of the
task proceeded as follows: the experimenter placed one or two objects on
the left and/or right sides of the table, out of reach of the child so
that the child could not interact with the toys during the labeling
event. For one-object trials, the location of the object (left or right)
alternated between trials. After placing the objects, the experimenter
said ``Hey look, there's a (target) here.'' The experimenter gazed at
the center of the table rather than the object she was labeling because
we wanted to preserve referential ambiguity throughout the trial. The
experimenter waited approximately two seconds (based on a visual
metronome placed within view) before saying, ``Can you put the (target)
in the bucket?'' She then pushed the object(s) forward within reach of
the child, and placed a plastic bucket in the center of the table, also
within reach of the child. Prior to the twelve experimental trials,
there were two training trials: a one-familiar trial and a two-familiar
trial, to acquaint the child with the procedure. A camera placed to the
side of the experimenter captured the participant's face, so that
looking behavior could be coded from video.

\subsubsection{Coding procedure}\label{coding-procedure}

Videos were coded using DataVyu software (\url{http://datavyu.org}).
First, each trial was divided into four temporal phases: a \emph{label}
phase, which began at the utterance of the target label and ended when
the experimenter began to slide the objects, a \emph{slide} phase, which
encompassed the sliding of the objects into the child's reach, a
\emph{planning phase}, which began at the end of the slide and ended
when the child touched an object, and a \emph{response} phase, which
began when the child touched an object and ended when the child released
the object into the bucket. After onsets and offsets of these phases had
been coded, the coder recorded the number of looks the child made to the
experimenter during each phase. We opted to code the number of looks
because we expected that children might look between the speaker and
objects to solve the problem of reference. A second coder independently
scored the number of looks for one third of the trials for each
participant to establish reliability.

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

Results of Experiment 1 are presented in Figure \ref{fig:results_e1}.
Inter-rater reliability for the number of looks in each phase was high,
intraclass correlation \emph{r} = .97, \emph{p}\textless{}.001. To test
our prediction that referential ambiguity (i.e., having two novel
objects) would produce more social referencing, we fit mixed-effects
linear regression models separately for each phase with the following
structure:
\texttt{number\ of\ looks\ \textasciitilde{}\ number\ of\ objects\ *\ familiarity\ *\ age\ in\ months\ +\ (number\ of\ objects\ +\ familiarity\ \textbar{}\ SID)}.
A single model with phase as a factor did not converge.

We did not find any main or interaction effects of number of objects,
familiarity, or age on number of looks during the label or slide phases.
Thus, mere novelty or the presence of multiple objects was not enough to
increase social referencing. However, we found an interaction effect of
number of objects and familiarity during the planning (\(\beta\) = 0.21,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001) and response phases (\(\beta\) = 0.6,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001), such that 2-novel trials were associated
with more looking. There was no interaction with age in either
phase.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/emilyfae/socref_uncert}} In
summary, children looked to the experimenter more often when planning
and executing a response under uncertainty. These results suggest that
children were aware that they did not have sufficient knowledge to
answer independently, and referenced the speaker to resolve this
uncertainty.

We did not find the expected effect of referential ambiguity in the
label phase. It is possible that children failed to predict that they
would need more information until later in the trial, when they were
actually faced with making a decision. Another possibility is that
children's looking was at ceiling during the labeling phase, perhaps
because children look at someone who is speaking regardless of the need
for referential disambiguation. A third possibility is that this is an
artifact of our design, in which the experimenter gazed at the center of
the table rather than the referent of her label. Children may have
realized that the experimenter's gaze direction during labeling was not
informative. Experiment 2 tests this possibility and examines whether
children's social referencing is sensitive to graded uncertainty.

\section{Experiment 2}\label{experiment-2}

Experiment 2 was designed to replicate Experiment 1 and to investigate
whether children's social referencing is sensitive to uncertainty based
on graded evidence about a label's referent. Since we did not observe
any difference between one-familiar and one-novel trials, we eliminated
single-object trials, leaving the 2-familiar and 2-novel trials. In
addition, we added 1-novel-1-familiar trials (``mutual exclusivity
trials''). For these trials, we expected that children would be able to
infer the referent by excluding the familiar object as a possibility.
For example, when a toy lion and a novel item were present, they could
exclude that the speaker was referring to the lion as a ``blicket''
(Markman \& Wachtel, 1988). We predicted that children might be less
certain about their choice on these trials compared to when the label
and referent were familiar to them (2-familiar trials), but more
confident than when there are no cues to reference (2-novel trials).

In addition, we manipulated between participants whether or not the
experimenter's gaze during labeling was informative (she gazed at either
the referent of her label or the center of the table), allowing us to
determine whether children selectively reference gaze during labeling
when gaze is expected to be informative. The manipulation of
informativity of gaze during labeling also meant that participants in
the referential gaze condition had an additional referential cue, which
might decrease uncertainty for the remainder of the trial. In Experiment
1, we did not observe an effect of age on looking. Thus, we restricted
the current sample to 3- and 4-year-olds.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited a planned sample of 80 children ages 3-4 years from the
Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, California.\footnote{Planned
  sample size, exclusion criteria, and analysis plan preregistered at
  \url{https://osf.io/y7mvt/}.}. The sample included 40 3-year-olds
(mean age 42.89 months) and 40 4-year-olds (mean age 53.47 months). An
additional 20 children participated but were removed from analyses
because they heard English less than 75\% of the time at home (\emph{n}
= 9), because they were unable to complete at least half of the trials
in the task (\emph{n} = 7), or due to experimenter or technical errors
(\emph{n} = 4).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design-1}

The stimuli and design were similar to Experiment 1, except that we
eliminated 1-object trials. Instead, we included three trial types:
2-familiar (``familiar''), 2-novel (``novel''), and 1-novel-1-familiar
(``mutual exclusivity''). There were four of each trial type, totaling
twelve trials. In addition, we manipulated the experimenter's gaze
behavior between participants. For half of the participants, she looked
at the center of the table while she labeled the object on every trial;
for the remaining half, she looked at the object she referred to while
she labeled the object on every trial.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1, except that there were
three practice trials rather than two, which were comprised of two
familiar trials and one novel trial. We included two familiar trials
during the practice so that children would experience the satisfaction
of picking the correct object and remain motivated to complete the task.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion-1}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.75in,height=3.5in]{figs/results_e2-1} 

}

\caption[Results of Experiment 2]{Results of Experiment 2. Number of looks to the experimenter across phases and conditions. Error bars are 95 percent confidence intervals.}\label{fig:results_e2}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

Results of Experiment 2 are presented in Figure \ref{fig:results_e2}.
Inter-rater reliability for the number of looks in each phase was again
high, intraclass correlation \emph{r} = .97, \emph{p}\textless{}.001. To
quantify the main and interactive effects of familiarity, gaze
informativity, phase, and age on social referencing, we fit a
mixed-effects linear regression model with the following structure:
\texttt{number\ of\ looks\ \textasciitilde{}\ familiarity\ *\ age\ in\ months\ *\ gaze\ *\ phase\ +\ (familiarity\ \textbar{}\ SID)}.
In contrast to Experiment 1, a model with phase as a predictor
converged.

First, do children reference a speaker more often when the objects and
label are novel? Phase interacted with familiarity such that the
response phase of novel trials was associated with significantly more
looks (\(\beta\) = 0.51, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). This result is
consistent with our finding from the analysis of the response phase in
Experiment 1. However, in contrast to Experiment 1, we did not observe
that looking was significantly greater for novel trials in the planning
phase.

We were also interested in whether mutual exclusivity trials would
elicit an intermediate amount of uncertainty. We observed a three-way
interaction of familiarity, gaze, and phase, such that the response
phase of mutual exclusivity trials in the no-referential-gaze condition
was associated with significantly more looks (\(\beta\) = 0.39, \emph{p}
\textless{} .01). Thus, mutual exclusivity trials were associated with
greater looking only when the experimenter did not provide informative
gaze. This finding is intriguing given that children should be able to
solve mutual exclusivity trials without gaze information. Instead, they
appear to remain relatively uncertain while making a decision if
excluding the familiar object is their only cue to reference, but this
uncertainty is resolved if the speaker's gaze is informative. On the
other hand, informative gaze during labeling did not lessen social
referencing for novel trials, suggesting that gaze information alone was
not sufficient to reduce uncertainty. Instead, both gaze information and
mutual exclusivity provided evidence about a label-object pairing, and
children required both types of evidence to feel certain about their
response.

Finally, we observed a four-way interaction such that the response phase
of novel trials in the gaze condition was associated with more looking
with increasing age (\(\beta\) = 0.06, \emph{p} \textless{} .01),
suggesting that children may become more selective in their social
referencing as they get older. It may be that children improve in their
ability to monitor the need for disambiguating information, or they may
become more likely to recognize that social information can be a source
of disambiguation.

Lastly, we again did not find selective social referencing during the
label phase, even when referential gaze was available. This result rules
out the possibility that children were less selective during labeling
because they learned that gaze direction was not informative.

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

During the preschool years, children are increasingly able to actively
gather their own information through help-seeking and exploration
(Chouinard et al., 2007; Schulz \& Bonawitz, 2007). Do children monitor
their own uncertainty to guide these behaviors, or are they
indiscriminate with regard to underlying knowledge states? Here, we
examined whether preschool-aged children's social referencing during a
word-learning task was driven by uncertainty about a label's referent.

We found that referential ambiguity strongly predicted children's social
referencing. Specifically, we observed this selectivity when children
were forced to decide which object the speaker was referring to. We
speculate that children referenced the speaker during the decision
process because they expected confirmation of the accuracy of their
choice, either implicitly through the adult's facial expressions, or
through explicit feedback. This idea is consistent with other recent
research that has found that preschool-aged children seek help
selectively when they are less likely to succeed, because a problem is
difficult or because they are less skilled (Vredenburgh \& Kushnir,
2015).

Most intriguingly, we found that children's looking was driven by graded
referential evidence. In the case of mutual exclusivity trials, children
could solve the problem of reference by excluding the familiar item
(Markman \& Wachtel, 1988). Thus, unlike novel trials, they likely had
some signal about the correct object-label mapping. If children simply
monitored the presence or absence of such signals, they would have
consistently treated mutual exclusivity trials as familiar trials.
Instead, their social referencing depended on a combination of cues from
mutual exclusivity and gaze informativity, suggesting that they are
sensitive to graded evidence and seek disambiguating information only
when uncertainty is relatively high. Children's greater social
referencing on trials with only one cue to reference (i.e., mutual
exclusivity trials with no referential gaze and novel trials with
referential gaze) additionally suggests that children may remain
uncertain about a new label-object mapping if they have not received
confirmation of its accuracy, for example, through explicit feedback or
gaze direction.

On the other hand, we found no evidence for selective social referencing
as the object was being labeled. One possibility is that young children
do not recognize the need for disambiguating information until they need
to make a decision. Another possibility is that preschool-aged children
spontaneously look at a speaker regardless of ambiguity, and additional
looking was not needed or possible. Notably, Vaish et al. observed
selective referencing during labeling among infants. Since infants in
that study were holding one of the objects during labeling, referencing
the speaker would have required them to disengage from that object, and
may therefore have been more costly, promoting selectivity. Future
research with preschoolers that includes a greater reward trade off
between attentional options would help to distinguish among these
possibilities. Overall, these results provide evidence that
preschool-aged children monitor graded uncertainty in their mental
representations and act on that uncertainty through spontaneous
information-seeking.
